## Introduction

This project is a Java banking project meant to show OOP concepts through a simplified real world banking application. Accounts can be created for users, along with an account number. After account creation, the user can then track and manage transactions just as a normal banking application would allow (Checking balance, Depositing/Withdrawing funds, Calculating interest on funds in the account, and logging out.)

## Dependencies

This project requires Java to be installed on the system running the application. Also, knowing how to create a new Java object is required at this time, as it's currently the only way to create a user account and account number. 

## Future Improvements

I plan on adding functionality after building a web app interface for this project. My goal is to allow actions on a web application that will utilize the methods in this project and return the output to the web application versus the console, which is the current way to interact with this project. 

## Credits

I built this application after researching and watching many YouTube videos/tutorials. While many of the items are similar, I have adjusted this project to make it my own.
